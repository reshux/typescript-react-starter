# TypeScript React Starter

This is a very basic boilerplate React-TypeScript setup. Let's start of with the basics. If you haven't already, go ahead and install `create-react-app` globally. 

`npm install -g create-react-app`

Let's initialize our app. I'll be naming my app `typescript-react-starter`. Long and descriptive, I like it better this way for tutorialish things. Little things in life. 

`create-react-app typescript-react-starter --typescript`

Notice the `--typescript` flag. This is actually a novelty (well, not so much). This is the only thing we need to specify, TypeScript is natively supported by React for sometime now. Before though, we had to define `--scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`. `react-scripts-ts` is still available but deprecated.
